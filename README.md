# MFR Utility
The primary responsibility of Air Force Officers is to facilitate mission readiness through effective Asset Management, ensuring that Airmen are equipped with the necessary resources and tools to succeed. However, this operational focus is significantly hindered by the administrative burden of manual documentation. The Memorandum for Record (MFR) is the standard instrument for documenting official actions across the Department of the Air Force, yet its creation remains an inefficient, manual process that drains valuable leadership time. Current workflows require personnel to devote excessive attention to the strict formatting constraints outlined in DAFH 33-337 (The Tongue and Quill). Officers must manually adjust margins, spacing, office symbols, and signature blocks to ensure compliance, a process that is prone to human error and inconsistency. This lack of standardization forces leaders to shift their cognitive bandwidth from logistics and resource management to word processing, resulting in rejected documents and lost man-hours. To resolve this capability gap, there is a critical need for a software solution that decouples content entry from document formatting. By implementing a system where users simply input raw variables—such as office symbols, titles, and body text—and leverage an automated engine to render the output, the Air Force can ensure 100% compliance with The Tongue and Quill. This technological intervention will eliminate administrative friction, streamlining the MFR process and allowing Officers to return to their core mission: supporting the Airmen.

**Architecture**: This application is a PWA built in React and TS (Vite). We will use TipTap as our headless editor base, and React-PDF's Renderer to render the PDF. To manage current state and memory, we will use Zustand to handle some typed variables, and IDB-Keyval to store data about the user locally in their browser.
